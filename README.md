## AUTPRIMEAPP
#Brief description of AUTPRIMEAPP

The AUT Prime app is a mobile application dedicated to provide easy access of Auckland University of Technology online services to its students.
Services include student email, courses, grades, campus maps, calendar, notes and even provide a notepad function for the students notes.


***IMPORTANT***
This app is unfortunately, experiencing some integration issues and therefore it is not possible to test the app as a whole. We were only able to integrate everything except notes and maps, which have their own repositories or devices. Notes is stored in AUTPrimeApp, while Maps only works on Developer Johns devices. 

In order to test the functionality of the app, please follow these instructions.

1. Clone the repo (Master) into Android Studio.
2. You may have to install suitable platforms and/or sync the project once cloned. It should ask you to do so if need be.
3. Checkout from the master to the remote branches connected to this repo.
4. Create a local branch onto your machine.
5. Once these steps have been followed, the code for the branches should be open, and you should be able to run them.

The currently functioning branches are as follows; 
MainActivity, HomepageActivity, CourseActivity, EmailActivity, MapActivity, CalendarActivity, GradeActivity and LogoutActivity
